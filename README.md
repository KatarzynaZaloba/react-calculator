## **How it works**
![Calculator GIF](./public/gif.gif)

It was really fun for me to taking care of this currency calculator. It's in Polish. You can count there a value from PLN into EUR, USD, CHF and GBP. 

To do that you need to enter your amount of money in PLN, then you can select the currency from the list you want to convert into:
- EUR,
- USD,
- CHF
- GBP.

After that you receive a final amount in other currency.

 ## **Technologies used in the project**
To create the application I have used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Normalize
- BEM convention
- JavaScript
- ES6+ features
- GIT
- Markdown
- Immutability
- React

## **About me** ## 

Hello everyone! My name is Katarzyna. I used to work in **IT department** for the last circa 3 years as an **IT Process Coordinator**. I gained experience as a **Personal Data Officer** since Nov 2021 too. 
Impossible? Nothing is impossible if you are really into something! 
I was resposible for the procedures and instructions related with quality in the organization. As you can see my mind is open and I like to learn new things. 
Since Dec 2022 I am developing my skills in my *Frontend Developer* course by *YouCode*. 

And I will stand with this.

In my free time I am jogging through the forest near my home - in my opinion it's the best solution for your body and mind!

That's it from me for now. If you would like to know more about my eperience, please visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-zaloba/) .

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
